# dr-quine

The goal of this project is to create 3 programs, named Colleen, Grace and Sully in C and Assembly each of them. These programs will have the same behaviors : being a quine program, which means that it has to output its source code.

#### Colleen

- Main function
- One comment in the main function
- One comment outside of the main function
- Another function called in the main function

#### Grace

- Program writes in a file named Grace_kid.c/Grace_kid.s the source code of the file used to compile the program.
- No main declared
- Three defines only
- One comment
- The program will run by calling a macro

#### Sully

- Program writes in a file named Sully_X.c / Sully_X.s. The X will be an integer present in the source code
